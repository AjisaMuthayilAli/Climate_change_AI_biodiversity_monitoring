### Climate_change_AI_biodiversity_monitoring
Climate change is one of the main reasons for drastic environmental changes such as drought, flood, wild fires, excessive heat, salt water intrusion in fresh water sources due to sea level rise etc. Therefore, climate change does impact negatively on the biodiversity of the ecosystem. It results in biodiversity reduction and migration. Coral reef bleaching due to rise in ocean water temperature, reduction/migration of polar bear in arctic and extinction of bramble cay melomys are examples of climate change adverse effects. It is possible that by preserving and re-storing biodiversity, climate change can be mitigated. Machine learning (ML) can be used to identify and classify images. In this project the baseline biodiversity matrix and trends across wide range of ecosystem in animal kingdom were assessed by classifying animals in the Karoo National Park, South Africa to advise policy makers. 

Lab1: [Snapshot Karoo dataset](https://lila.science/datasets/snapshot-karoo) were used in this lab and are already annotated via [zooinverse voluntary programme](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/shuebner729/snapshot-karoo/classify). Explorataory data analysis and visualisation was done.
